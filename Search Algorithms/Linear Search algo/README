Linear search

Problem - Given an array of ‘n’ elements and a target element ‘t’, find the index of ‘t’ in the
array. Return -1 if the target element is not found.

arr =[-5, 2, 10, 4, 6], t= 10 -> Should return 2
arr =[-5, 2, 10, 4, 6], t= 6 -> Should return 4
arr = [-5, 2, 10, 4, 6], t = 20 -> Should return -1
